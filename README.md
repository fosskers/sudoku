# Sudoku

A sudoku solver for Python 3.

Written in 2011 March and resurrected from an old machine in 2020. My second
ever Python program of any significance.

This also happens to be set up as a solution for Project Euler 96, and as such
can solve multiple puzzles in a row provided the data file is formatted
properly.

## Usage

```
> python sudoku.py hard1.txt
```
